<p>My name is Josh Viturino. I am very new to computers. In 2020, I moved from Southern California to Høysand Norway, to be with my long-time girlfriend. In January of 2021 we got married. The move from California to Norway has been interesting, going from a city of 36 million to a country of only 5 million. I love to surf, which has change with the move, going from warm mellow surf in SoCal to icy, raw, unpredictable surf here in Norway. You might be asking, why I am doing school in the states when I live in Norway. The answer is that I must have one to two years of “upper secondary school” to go to college here. There is no “AA” degree here. An AA is part of the high school curriculum here in Norway.</p>
<h2>What I like to do in my free time</h2>
